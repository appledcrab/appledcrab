## ðŸŒ± Hey! I'm Sam!ðŸŒ±

---
I'm a software engineer and developer interested in web development, mobile development and a little bit of game design on the side.

Outside of tech, I play games from time to time and draw when I can.
(participating in Art Fight this year ðŸ‘€)
Favorite Games:
- Overwatch
- Outer Wilds
- Hollow Knight

âš¡I am currently working on a project of making a better bug journal for myself + a new portfolio :) (Updated 7/7/25)
